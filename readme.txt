Since no framework was mentioned, soo developed in pure javescript and jquery using external library lodash and semantic UI.

To run this project:
Connent to internet(to download fonts)
Open the the index.html
And its good to go.

I used localStorage to store the game state, soo the game can be resume after refresh the page also.

Please connect back if you found any difficulty while running this project.
