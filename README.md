# Board-game
Since no framework was mentioned, soo developed in pure javescript and jquery using external library lodash and semantic UI.

To run this project:
Connent to internet(to download fonts)
Open the the index.html
And its good to go.

Used localStorage to store the game state, soo the game can be resume after refresh the page also.
